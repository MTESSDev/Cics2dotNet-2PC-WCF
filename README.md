# Cics2dotNet-2PC-WCF
Here a working cobol program to show how to do 2PC from CICS requester to IIS. You only need to correctly configure custom binding and extract the SingleWSDL from your service (.svc) and run that on mainframe side to create COBOL structures.

```cobol
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
